  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,918 out of  17,344   11%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,225 out of  17,344   18%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,554 out of   8,672   29%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,554 out of   2,554 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,554   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,397 out of  17,344   19%
