WARNING:Pack:501 - The I/O component SPI_SCK has conflicting DRIVE property
   values.  The symbol SPI_SCK has property value 8.  The symbol ospiclk/obufi
   has property value usenglish/Pack.  The system will use the property value
   attached to symbol SPI_SCK.
WARNING:Pack:501 - The I/O component TXD has conflicting DRIVE property values. 
   The symbol TXD has property value 8.  The symbol obuftx/obufi has property
   value usenglish/Pack.  The system will use the property value attached to
   symbol TXD.
WARNING:Pack:501 - The I/O component SPI_CS has conflicting DRIVE property
   values.  The symbol SPI_CS has property value 8.  The symbol ospics/obufi has
   property value usenglish/Pack.  The system will use the property value

WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator zpuino/core/w1_tos_4_mux0002181 failed
   to merge with F5 multiplexer zpuino/core/prefr_spnext_mux0000<4>89.  There is
   a conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    4
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,309 out of   4,896   47%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,399 out of   4,896   69%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,280 out of   2,448   93%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,280 out of   2,280 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,280   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,612 out of   4,896   73%
    Number used as logic:             3,318
    Number used as a route-thru:        213
    Number used as Shift registers:      81

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
