Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    5
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,326 out of   4,896   47%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,311 out of   4,896   67%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,226 out of   2,448   90%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,226 out of   2,226 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,226   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,541 out of   4,896   72%
    Number used as logic:             3,243
    Number used as a route-thru:        230
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:      22
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      46

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
