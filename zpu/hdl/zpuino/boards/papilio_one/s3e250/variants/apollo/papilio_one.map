Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    3
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,515 out of   4,896   51%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             4,056 out of   4,896   82%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,389 out of   2,448   97%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,389 out of   2,389 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,389   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       4,326 out of   4,896   88%
    Number used as logic:             3,958
    Number used as a route-thru:        270
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:      16
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      82

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
