Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   17
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,146 out of   9,312   23%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,651 out of   9,312   39%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,786 out of   4,656   59%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,786 out of   2,786 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,786   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,931 out of   9,312   42%
    Number used as logic:             3,568
    Number used as a route-thru:        280

      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      67

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
