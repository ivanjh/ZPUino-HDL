WARNING:Pack:501 - The I/O component SPI_SCK has conflicting DRIVE property
   values.  The symbol SPI_SCK has property value 8.  The symbol ospiclk/obufi
   has property value usenglish/Pack.  The system will use the property value
   attached to symbol SPI_SCK.

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    5
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,141 out of   9,312   22%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,277 out of   9,312   35%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,480 out of   4,656   53%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,480 out of   2,480 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,480   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,508 out of   9,312   37%
    Number used as logic:             3,209
    Number used as a route-thru:        231

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
