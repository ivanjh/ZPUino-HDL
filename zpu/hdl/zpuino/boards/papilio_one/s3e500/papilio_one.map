WARNING:Pack:501 - The I/O component SPI_SCK has conflicting DRIVE property
   values.  The symbol SPI_SCK has property value 8.  The symbol ospiclk/obufi
   has property value usenglish/Pack.  The system will use the property value
   attached to symbol SPI_SCK.

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    5
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,420 out of   9,312   25%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,773 out of   9,312   40%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,753 out of   4,656   59%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,753 out of   2,753 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,753   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,991 out of   9,312   42%
    Number used as logic:             3,676
    Number used as a route-thru:        218

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
