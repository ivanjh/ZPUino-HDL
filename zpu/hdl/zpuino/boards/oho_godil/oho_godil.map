WARNING:Pack:501 - The I/O component SPI_SCK has conflicting DRIVE property
   values.  The symbol SPI_SCK has property value 16.  The symbol ospiclk/obufi
   has property value usenglish/Pack.  The system will use the property value
   attached to symbol SPI_SCK.
WARNING:Pack:501 - The I/O component TXD has conflicting DRIVE property values. 
   The symbol TXD has property value 16.  The symbol obuftx/obufi has property
   value usenglish/Pack.  The system will use the property value attached to
   symbol TXD.
WARNING:Pack:501 - The I/O component SPI_MOSI has conflicting DRIVE property
   values.  The symbol SPI_MOSI has property value 16.  The symbol
   ospimosi/obufi has property value usenglish/Pack.  The system will use the

WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator zpuino/core/w1_tos_4_mux0002190 failed
   to merge with F5 multiplexer zpuino/core/prefr_spnext_mux0000<4>89.  There is
   a conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    5
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,444 out of   9,312   26%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,839 out of   9,312   41%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,610 out of   4,656   56%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,610 out of   2,610 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,610   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       4,057 out of   9,312   43%
    Number used as logic:             3,725

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
